# Install
```npm install``` to install the dependencies.
```npm start``` to run a local server (usually at localhost:3000). This app uses the scripts provided by create_react_app.

# The app
This app aims to be an improvement compared to links.
* The UI is minimal and does not use any CSS framework.
* All interactions happen inline so that the user does not have to juggle with multiple tabs.
* Even if the user is momentarily offline, they are not prevented from using the app.
* The app relies on local storage to allow returning users to start interacting without having to wait for server responses.

This app is also different from links: The content of the app consists of coherent lists of curated links.
